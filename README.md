## Monterail's React Native Web template

Hi Monteloper!

So you're about to kick off with this brand new project? How exciting!
To make your life easier we've prepared this template with some stuff (e.g. libraries, configs etc.) that you should find helpful during development.

#### To create fresh project based on the template just run:

```
react-native init --template https://github.com/monterail/monteway-react-native-web "ProjectName"
```
Make sure that you have new version of `react-native` installed globally or run with `npx`.
